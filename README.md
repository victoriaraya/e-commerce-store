# Victoria's Shop

## Description

Victoria's Shop is an e-commerce website I built from scratch using React and Express. This is the first major project I built independently, with the intention of getting more experience with React, REST API design, working with databases, authentication, properly integrating third-party APIs and CSS. I thought making my own cute shop 'selling' products I'm actually interested in would be a fun way to do that and it definitely was.

In building this project I learnt alot about working with react, like properly managing context and state and integrating different components. I also learn alot about connecting the UI with data creation and retrieval and properly managing the communication between the two so that things operate how I want them to. I never worked extensively with CSS before this project either, so I learnt so much about using it to create what I want to visually. After completing this project, there are countless little things that I know I will encounter in the future which I can complete quickly and easily now since I took the time to figure it out on my own at first.
